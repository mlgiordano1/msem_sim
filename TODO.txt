Steps for simulation
1. DONE - Generate data (start with all normal)
	MPLUS or R? MPLUS
	(this will be in the genData folder)
	
2. Generate MPLUS scripts to fit models
	(fit models folder)
	
3. Write code to split variance at Between vs. Within 
4. Aggregate R-results
5. Aggregate Mplus results

6. Go back through paper
